# OpenAI Simple Webpage

This project provides a minimal web interface for experimenting with the OpenAI API. It exposes a single page with two text areas (context and prompt). Submitting the form sends both fields to a small Express server, which forwards them to the OpenAI Chat Completion API and returns the generated text.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your OpenAI API key.
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Navigate to <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.
   The page displays the LLM reply as a JSON object with `prompt`, `context`
   and `answer` fields.

## Files

- `server.js` – Express server that proxies requests to OpenAI.
- `public/index.html` – Minimal page with two text fields and a submit button.
- `example.py` – Example Python script that calls the server and prints a
  DSPy-style record.

This example requires Node.js v16 or higher.
